# Design Networking Implementation (15-20%)

## Design Azure virtual networks

* Design solutions that use Azure networking services: design for load balancing using Azure Load Balancer and Azure Traffic Manager
* Define DNS, DHCP, and IP strategies
* Determine when to use Azure Application Gateway
* Determine when to use multi-node application gateways, Traffic Manager and load balancers

## Design external connectivity for Azure Virtual Networks

* Determine when to use Azure VPN, ExpressRoute and Virtual Network Peering architecture and design
* Determine when to use User Defined Routes (UDRs)
* Determine when to use VPN gateway site-to-site failover for ExpressRoute 

## Design security strategies

* Determine when to use network virtual appliances
* Design a perimeter network (DMZ)
* Determine when to use a Web Application Firewall (WAF), Network Security Group (NSG), and virtual network service tunneling

## Design connectivity for hybrid applications

* Design connectivity to on-premises data from Azure applications using Azure Relay Service, Azure Data Management Gateway for Data Factory, Azure On-Premises Data Gateway, Hybrid Connections, or Azure Web Appâ€™s virtual private network (VPN) capability
* Identify constraints for connectivity with VPN
* Identify options for joining VMs to domains
